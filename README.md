## Product Concept

- Adansons Base is a data management tool that organizes meta-information of unstructured data and creates and organizes datasets.
- It makes dataset creation more effective and helps find essential insights from training results and improves AI performance.

## 1. Installation

Adansons Base contains Command Line Interface (CLI) and Python SDK, and you can install both with `pip` command.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/adansons/base
```

> Note: if you want to use CLI in any directory, you have to install with the python globally installed on your computer.

## 2. Configuration

### 2.1 with CLI

when you run any Base CLI command for the first time, Base will ask your access key provided on our slack.

then, Base will verify the specified access key was correct.

if you don't have any access key, please enter your email to [Get Invitation Form](https://share.hsforms.com/1KG8Hp2kwSjC6fjVwwlklZA8moen).

this command will show you what projects you have

```bash
base list
```

<details><summary>Output</summary>

```
Welcome to Adansons Base!!

Let's start with your access key provided on our slack.

Please register your access_key: xxxxxxxxxx

Successfully configured as xxxx@yyyy.com

projects
========
```
</details>

### 2.2 Environment Variables

if you don’t want to configure interactively, you can use environment variables for configuration.

`BASE_USER_ID` is used for identification of users, this is the email address you submitted via our form.

```bash
export BASE_ACCESS_KEY=xxxxxxxxxx
export BASE_USER_ID=xxxx@yyyy.com
```

## 3. Tutorial 1: Organize meta data and Create dataset

let’s start Base tutorial with mnist dataset.

### Step 0. prepare sample dataset

install dependencied for download dataset at first.

```bash
pip install pypng
```

then, download a script for mnist from our Base repository

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adansons/base/main/download_mnist.py > download_mnist.py
```

run download-mnist script. you can specify any folder for downloading as last argument(default “~/dataset/mnist”). if you run this command on Windows, please replace it to windows path like “C:\dataset\mnist”

```bash
python3 ./download_mnist.py ~/dataset/mnist
```

> Note: Base can link the data files if you put anywhere in local computer. So if you already downloaded mnist dataset, you can use it

after downloading, you can see data files in ~/dataset/mnist.

```
~
└── dataset
     └── mnist
          ├── train
          │ 	 ├── 0
          │ 	 │   ├── 1.png
          │ 	 │   ├── ...
          │ 	 │   └── 59987.png
          │ 	 ├── ...
          │ 	 └── 9
          └──	test
                ├── 0
                └── ...
```

### Step 1. create new project

create mnist project with [base new <project>](https://vast-bus-1c4.notion.site/Command-Reference-20fe913cdf2541cc90812f69de0ae083#70af41e65b51453f9b6807dc29354002) command.

```bash
base new mnist
```

<details><summary>Output</summary>

```
Your Project UID
----------------
abcdefghij0123456789

save Project UID in local file (~/.base/projects)
```
</details>

Base will issue a Project Unique ID and automatically save it in local file.

### Step 2. import data files

after the step 0, you have many png image files on ”~/dataset/mnist” directory.

let’s upload meta data related their paths into mnist project with `base import` command.

```bash
base import mnist --directory ~/dataset/mnist --extension png --parse "{dataType}/{label}/{id}.png"
```

> Note: if you changed download folder, please replace “~/dataset/mnist” in above command.

<details><summary>Output</summary>

```
Check datafiles...
found 70000 files with png extension.
Success!
```
</details>

### Step 3. import external metadata files

if you have external meta data files, you can integrate them into existing project database with `—-external-file` option.

in this time, we use `wrongImagesInMNISTTestset.csv` published at Github by youkaichao.

[https://github.com/youkaichao/mnist-wrong-test](https://github.com/youkaichao/mnist-wrong-test)

this is the extra meta data which correct wrong label on mnist test dataset.

you can evaluate your model more strictly and correctly by using these extra meta data with Base.

download external csv

```bash
curl -SL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/youkaichao/mnist-wrong-test/master/wrongImagesInMNISTTestset.csv > ~/Downloads/wrongImagesInMNISTTestset.csv
```

```bash
base import mnist --external-file --path ~/Downloads/wrongImagesInMNISTTestset.csv -a dataType:test
```

<details><summary>Output</summary>

```
1 tables found!
now estimating the rule for table joining...

1 table joining rule was estimated!
Below table joining rule will be applied...

Rule no.1

        key 'index'     ->      connected to 'id' key on exist table
        key 'originalLabel'     ->      connected to 'label' key on exist table
        key 'correction'        ->      newly added

1 tables will be applied
Table 1 sample record:
        {'index': 8, 'originalLabel': 5, 'correction': '-1'}

Do you want to perform table join?
        Base will join tables with that rule described above.

        'y' will be accepted to approve.

        Enter a value: y
Success!
```
</details>

### Step 4. filter and export dataset with CLI

now, we are ready to create dataset.

let’s pick up a part of data files, label is 0, 1, or 2 for training, from project mnist with `base search <project>` command.

you can use `--conditions <value-only-search>` option for magical search filter and `--query <key-value-pair-search>` option for advanced filter.

be careful that you may get so large output on your console without `-s, --summary` option.

(check [search docs](https://vast-bus-1c4.notion.site/Command-Reference-20fe913cdf2541cc90812f69de0ae083#698aab257e884e6a82cf470ec7f459dc) for more information).

```bash
base search mnist --conditions "train" --query "label in ['1','2','3']"
```

> Note: in query option, you have to specified each component as string in list without space like `“[’1’,’2’,’3’]”`, when you want to operate `in` or `not in` query.
> 

<details><summary>Output</summary>

```
18831 files
========
'/home/xxxx/dataset/mnist/train/1/42485.png'
...
```
</details>

> Note: If you specify no conditions or query, Base will return whole data files.

### Step 5. filter and export dataset with Python SDK

in python script, you can filter and export dataset easily and simply with `Project class` and `Files class`. (see [SDK docs](https://vast-bus-1c4.notion.site/Python-Reference-9155322393ee417a967a8e05817e8b25))

```python
from base import Project, Dataset

# export dataset as you want to use
project = Project("mnist")
files = project.files(conditions="train", query=["label in ['1','2','3']"])

print(files[0])
# this returns path-like `File` object
# -> '/home/xxxx/dataset/mnist/0/12909.png'
print(files[0].label)
# this returns the value of attribute 'lable' of first `File` object
# -> '0'

dataset = Dataset(files, target_key="label", transform=preprocess_func)
x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = dataset.train_test_split(split_rate=0.2)

# or use with torch
import torch

dataset = Dataset(files, target_key="label", transform=preprocess_func)
loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
```

finally, let’s try one of most characteristic use cases on Adansons Base.

in the external file you imported in step.3, some mnist test data files are annotated as `“-1”` in correction column. this means that it is difficult to classify that files even for human.

so, you should exclude that files from your dataset to evaluate your AI models more properly.

```python
# you can exclude files which have "-1" on "correction" with below code
eval_files = project.Files(conditions="test", query=["correction != -1"])

print(len(eval_files))
# this returns the number of files matched with requested conditions or query
# -> 9963

eval_dataset = Dataset(eval_files, target_key="label", transform=preprocess_func)
```
